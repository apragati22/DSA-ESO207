# DSA-ESO207
Contains the assignments submitted for the course ESO207 (Data Structures and Algorithms), offered in 2023-24 Sem I, under the instructor Raghunath Tewari at IITK.
I had submitted three programming assignments and three theoretical assignments during the course. The prog assignments had to be solved through a contest on [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/), while for the theoretical assignments, we had to write the pseudo-codes for the algorithm, analyse its time complexity and give the proof of correctness.
Each assignment has a separate folder and a README file describing it.
